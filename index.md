## Perspective in Whiplash

When I first heard of Whiplash, the movie by Damien Chazelle, it didn't really seem like something I'd enjoy. I knew absolutely nothing of Jazz music at the time and when it comes to drumming I'm still as lost as I ever was. I don't exactly remember what sequence of events finally led to me actually watching the film, but it quickly became apparent that Jazz music and drumming weren't really the point of the movie at all. Instead, Whiplash follows the path of the obsessed artist and explores the concept of "greatness". It seeks to answer the question, what does it mean to be "great"?

The movie is, frankly, incredible, and analyzing it to the extent that it deserves would take far longer than a blog post allows. However, something interesting about this movie that very heavily relies on the strength of its audio - the drums, the Jazz - is actually its cinematography and specifically, the use of perspective. The rest of this post will explore some scenes in Whiplash that use perspective enhance the audience's experience and understanding of the movie's themes. There will be some spoilers ahead.

### Opening Scene
The movie opens with a shot of a long corridor in single-point perspective, naturally drawing the audience's attention to our protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who's practicing his drumming. The camera slowly moves in closer and closer, watching the drummer immersed in his work, who seems not to notice our presence at all. And suddenly, he stops, looks up sharply, the camera spins around and finds the main antagonist of the film, Terence Fletcher, a world reknowned teacher at the best Jazz school in New York City: Shaffer Conservatory.

The slow steady zooming in of the camera, all in one-point perspective, draws the audience in. Neyman is immersed and inattentive to anything outside of his drum set, and we too, as the audience, naturally zone out and become lost in the rhythm. It's easy to miss the fact that we've been getting closer to Neyman, until he looks up suddenly and breaks our spell. This frank stop to our trance is invasive, and the object of that invasion is none other the Fletcher. With no dialogue and fifteen seconds, the movie has introduced the protagonist, shown him to be hardworking, driven and obsessed, showcased his potential and also managed to introduce the unpleasant shock factor that Fletcher brings with him, now and for the rest of the movie.
